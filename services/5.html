        <p class="servicesText">In the ever-evolving landscape of real estate financing, Davila Finance offers an
            extensive range of mortgage loan options to suit various needs. Whether you're looking for a traditional
            mortgage to purchase your dream home or considering alternative lending options, we have you covered.
        <ul>
            <strong>Traditional Mortgage Loans</strong>
            For those seeking a straightforward, long-term financing solution, we offer a suite of traditional mortgage
            loans. These commonly include:
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>Fixed-Rate Mortgages:</strong> Lock in a constant interest rate for the life of the loan,
                offering predictability
                in
                your monthly payments.</li>
            <li> <strong>Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs):</strong> Benefit from lower initial rates that may adjust
                over time based on
                market
                conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>FHA Loans:</strong> Ideal for first-time homebuyers, requiring lower down payments and
                accommodating
                less-than-perfect credit.</li>
            <li><strong>Conventional Loans:</strong> With stricter credit requirements but more flexible terms, these
                loans are often
                best
                suited for those with strong financial profiles.</li>
            <li> Traditional mortgages are well-suited for individuals with stable income, good credit, and a
                willingness to
                commit to longer-term financial obligations.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <strong>Non-Traditional Mortgage Loans</strong>
            For clients with unique financial circumstances or those looking for more flexible lending options, we offer
            non-traditional mortgage loans, such as:
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>Interest-Only Mortgages:</strong> Make only interest payments for a set period, allowing lower
                initial monthly
                payments.</li>
            <li><strong>Balloon Mortgages:</strong> Make smaller initial payments with a large lump sum due at the end
                of the loan term.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Stated Income Loans:</strong> Suitable for self-employed or freelance individuals, these loans
                are approved based
                on
                a declaration of income rather than traditional proof.</li>
            <li><strong>Hard Money Loans:</strong> These are asset-based loans that are ideal for short-term real estate
                investment
                opportunities.</li>
            <li> Non-traditional loans are excellent solutions for those with variable incomes, investment-oriented
                financial
                goals, or unique property types.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <strong>Mortgage Loans for International Customers and Non-Residents</strong>

            international investors to acquire real estate properties in the United States.
            <li><strong>Foreign National Loans:</strong> Designed for non-U.S. citizens who are looking to invest in the
                American real
                estate
                market. Minimal documentation and flexible approval criteria set these loans apart.</li>
            <li> <strong>Non-Resident Portfolio Loans:</strong> A bespoke financing solution that accommodates the
                unique income
                structures of
                non-residents, such as income from international sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Border Financing:</strong> Tailored for those who have financial profiles in multiple
                countries, these
                loans
                take into account international credit reports and assets.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Currency Choice Mortgages:</strong> Choose the currency in which you'd like to make your
                mortgage payments,
                providing
                a hedge against currency fluctuations.
